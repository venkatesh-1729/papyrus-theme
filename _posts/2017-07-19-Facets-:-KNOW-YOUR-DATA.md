[PAIR](https://ai.google/pair) recently open-sourced [FACETS](https://pair-code.github.io/facets/) 
whose aim is to help engineers understand what goes into model by learning patterns in large corpora.

In their own words:
> The power of machine learning comes from its ability to learn patterns from large amounts of data.
> Understanding your data is critical to building a powerful machine learning system.

Here I'm experimenting with embedding FACETS web components and visualizing data.
Feel free to take a look and play with your own data.
